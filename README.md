### Hello there 👋 I am Kehinde Odunuga

A result-oriented quality assurance engineer committed to confirming proper functionality and usability of software products before release. 
I plan test schedules and strategies according to project scope and delivery dates. 
I monitor and track bug resolutions. 
Also review software documentation to verify technical accuracy and completeness to mitigate risks.
